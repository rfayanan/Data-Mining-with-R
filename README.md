# Data Mining with R
#### Using 3 different datasets, I learned to explore and visualize data on R Studio. The "Bostonhousing.csv" contains information collected by the US Bureau of the Census concerning housing in Boston. I created a linear regression model using it to predict housing prices based on variables such as proximity to Charles River and the level of nitrous oxide in the air. 

#### The file “banks.csv” includes data on a sample of 20 banks. The “Financial Condition” column records the judgment of an expert on the financial condition of each bank. This outcome variable takes one of two possible values-weak (coded as 1) or strong (coded as 0)-according to the financial condition of the bank. The predictors are two ratios used in the financial analysis of banks: TotLns&Lses/Assets is the ratio of total loans and leases to total assets and TotExp/Assets is the ratio of total expenses to total assets. I used the two ratios for classifying the financial condition of a new bank using a logistic regression model.
