# Data Mining with R

#### Using 3 different datasets, I explored and visualized data on R Studio. I used data mining techniques and predictive modeling (regression, classification, clustering, decision trees) to make business specific decisions for each of my assignments. I queried, cleaned and analyzed data as well as presented them in the form of boxplots, scatterplots, ggplots, barcharts etc.  

####The "Bostonhousing.csv" contains information collected by the US Bureau of the Census concerning housing in Boston. I created a linear regression model using it to predict housing prices based on variables such as proximity to Charles River and the level of nitrous oxide in the air. 

#### The file “banks.csv” includes data on a sample of 20 banks. The “Financial Condition” column records the judgment of an expert on the financial condition of each bank. This outcome variable takes one of two possible values-weak (coded as 1) or strong (coded as 0)-according to the financial condition of the bank. The predictors are two ratios used in the financial analysis of banks: TotLns&Lses/Assets is the ratio of total loans and leases to total assets and TotExp/Assets is the ratio of total expenses to total assets. I used the two ratios for classifying the financial condition of a new bank using a logistic regression model.

#### The "Toyota.csv" dataset contains data on used cars on sale during the late summer of 2004 in the Netherlands. I built 2 decision trees using the dataset, a simple one and a more complex one using the complexity parameter.

#### The dataset ‘Cereals.csv’ includes nutritional information, store display, and consumer ratings for 77 breakfast cereals. I applied hierarchical clustering to cluster these cereals based on their nutrition facts.
